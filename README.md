## Exercise

1. Humans initialize with a `first_name` and `last_name`.

2. Humans initialize with an `_age` of 0. This will be a property (`age`) later.

3. Give humans a `__repr__` that adequately shows their characteristics. You decide what this looks like.

4. Give humans a method `say_full_name` which returns their concatenated `first_name` and `last_name`.

5. Give humans a method `happy_birthday` which increments that human's age by 1.

6. Give humans a property `age`. When someone attempts to set a human's `age` directly it instead doesn't change and returns the string `"Quit lying about your age!"`.
